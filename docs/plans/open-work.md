# Open work: the one list

> **Status: Living.** Created 2026-09-29 from the earlier trackers, and
> rewritten the same evening as a clean slate after the local cleanup
> session (`main` at `3a51724` and the docs commit after it). Every item is
> either Done (with its commit or its operations record), waiting on one

## How to use this file

- **This is the only list of open work.** Plans, specs, ADRs and
  `agents/coordination.md` may describe a task in detail, but they don't
  track it. Anything "still open", "later" or "follow-up" must appear here.
- An agent takes an unblocked item, follows `AGENTS.md`, and works on a
  `task/<id>-<slug>` branch. When it lands, the item moves to **Done** with
  its commit hash.
- A new finding gets the next free `F` number (F36 is next) and goes in the
  right section.

Current baseline (2026-09-29, evening):
- `main` is the only long-lived branch, locally and on GitHub; production
  (`niyantran-six.vercel.app`) follows it.
- Supabase NTER: 36 migrations; 2 GB compute (`shared_buffers` 512 MB); six
  Edge Functions CLI-deployed from `b60c0dc` (`health` v10, `admin-models`
  v10, `refresh-model-pricing` v11, `ingest-documents` v14, `desk-brief` v5,
  `research-chat` v35). `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes the preview pattern.
- The corpus: 2,338 documents, 54,219 chunks and 34,184 desk rows. The
  search index is half precision, 204 MB.
- Tests:
  - 74 Vitest files (1,009 tests), 452 Deno tests, 16 SQL fixtures;
  - `npm run lint`: 0 errors, 0 warnings;
  - `scripts/verify-local-storage-paths.mjs`: 12 of 12 checks on a local
    stack.

  CI is advisory.

## 1. Done

Newest first. Detail is in `git log`, the linked documents and the
"Operations" entries in `agents/coordination.md`.

- **2026-10-01, F43 (local, `task/admin-records`):** `ad34438`. The chat panel kept
  resetting on every same-account auth event (tab refocus, token refresh), which dropped
  an unsent chat's attachments and draft and aborted a streaming answer. A same-account
  event now re-verifies quietly; a sign-out or another account still clears at once.
  Reproduced and verified in the browser on the local stack (the old code drops the
  attached row on one same-account `SIGNED_IN`; the fix keeps it; `SIGNED_OUT` clears it).

- **2026-09-29, evening (local session):**
  - Declutter before the new ingestion pipeline (owner-approved). Removed
    from the repository: eleven unused scripts, `api-status.pdf`,
    `_kpi_slides.txt`, `.oxlintrc.json`, the root
    `NTER_BACKEND_FIRST_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`, the deleted-branches archive
    in `docs/`, the never-deployed backend module (`backend/src`,
    `backend/index.ts`, `backend/package.json`, three invite functions) and
    the `extract`, `feed` and `export-map` npm scripts. `backend/sql` stays
    for the SQL fixtures. Outside git: `dist/` and `tmp/` removed, the old
    link map `ingest/national-desk/` moved to the Trash, the local Supabase
    stack's Docker images and volumes removed, and five superseded zips and
    folders in Downloads moved to the Trash. The corpus folder was first
    completed from its zip (7 files it lacked, about 1.1 GB, sizes and CRCs
    checked). The Supabase corpus is kept until the new pipeline replaces it.
  - O2, closed without deleting (owner's decision). Four Vercel variables
    are unused: `VITE_AI_BACKEND`, `PROJECT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and
    `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`. No code reads them, and nothing reads
    `import.meta.env` as a whole, so Vite puts neither `VITE_` value in the
    bundle. Google sign-in runs through Supabase's own provider settings.
    They stay because the Vercel tools can't delete variables; remove them
    whenever someone is in the dashboard.
  - D1 (part), the Auth redirect URLs: the owner added
    `http://localhost:5173/**` and `https://niyantran-*-ddl-labs.vercel.app/**`
    (site URL stays production). Verified by starting a Google sign-in from
    each origin and reading `auth.flow_state.referrer`: production, the
    `main` alias, a preview deployment and localhost each return to
    themselves, and an unknown origin falls back to production. Before
    this, the Auth logs showed a preview sign-in (28 Sep 08:43 UTC) landing
    on production. Google sign-in itself has worked since 27 Sep (5
    accounts).
  - P16, the home carousel shows only computed figures and true constants
    (`87dc8bf`):
    - computed: bills 9,817 (unique IDs; the feed repeats two rows),
      ministries 56, fronts 88, market instruments 9;
    - constants: 543 seats, 2 Houses, 36 states and UTs (was 28), 6 CBAM
      sectors, 27 EU states, 25 High Courts;
    - the invented figures are dropped.

    Its test fails on any figure outside those.
  - F13, a transient identity failure no longer signs the user out
    (`179a708`; spec `specs/2026-09-29-f13-transient-identity-failure.md`,
    `3a51724`, approved with no retry).
    - Network errors and 5xx refuse the request but keep the identity, the
      retained turns and the signed-in UI; callers show "Connection problem.
      Try again."
    - Authoritative failures still sign out.
    - The new tests fail on the old code.
    - In a browser against a local stack with PostgREST stopped, the old
      code dropped a valid session to the landing page on reload; the new
      code stays signed in.
  - F17, both untested database paths run against a local Supabase stack
    (`5259ffa`). `scripts/verify-local-storage-paths.mjs` checks:
    - the preferences merge-upsert through PostgREST, read back as the
      owner, with `service_role` refused;
    - the intro-video signed-URL upload, finalize, public read and delete.

    12 of 12 checks pass. The two merge checks fail when the handler nulls
    omitted fields. The script refuses any non-local URL.
  - C3 (T7), SQLite retired (`31c3915`):
    - the `entry_briefs` tier removed from `server/deskBrief.mjs`;
    - `server/db.mjs` and `sql.js` deleted;
    - `KNOWN_OFFENDERS` emptied, so the guard fails with both offences when
      SQLite is reinstated;
    - the seven tests' dead `db.mjs` mocks removed;
    - the two serverless specs marked Historical.

    O4: the laptop's only SQLite file held three 100-byte briefs written by
    a test run, so nothing was kept. The other worker's machine was not
    checked.
  - F1, `user_preferences.ai_chats` dropped (`92893f1`; migration 36, live
    and pinned). The `drop_ai_chats` fixture fails without the migration.
  - A1, all six Edge Functions redeployed with the standard CLI. The
    dashboard shows the real files, and each function was probed.
  - O5, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` includes `https://niyantran-*-ddl-labs.vercel.app`.
    Preview and deployment hosts are allowed; foreign origins are refused.
  - O3, the merged branches `task/docs-pass` and `task/f2-server-entitlements`
    deleted on GitHub.
  - F29, the `/api/home/latest` contract test runs offline (`b60c0dc`). It
    used to query live Supabase whenever `.env.local` existed. It now fails
    if the stub isn't used.

- **2026-09-29:**
  - F28, the nuclear-site map builds its marker labels from text nodes (`fillSiteLabel` in `src/lib/geoTip.js`, used by `NuclearSiteMap.jsx`). Its test fails on the old `innerHTML` code. Both helpers were also run in Chromium with an `<img onerror>` name: no element was created and the handler never ran. The other `innerHTML` uses are deliberate: `siteHead.js` injects the admin-configured head snippet and `bootLegacy.js` a same-origin static file.
  - F26, the map tooltip sets feed text with `textContent` (`src/lib/geoTip.js`, used by `GeoDotsMap.jsx`). Its test fails on the old `innerHTML` code with an `<img onerror>` name.
  - F27, test 13 of `scripts/test-auth-complete-suite.mjs` asserts the signed-out profile read. It uses a fresh client (the old `anonClient` had held the test user's session since test 10), and passes only on `42501` or zero rows, so a network error does not pass. `42501` confirmed live on NTER with `set local role anon`; the script itself was not run, because it creates real users.
  - F25, the lint backlog cleared:
    - ESLint 9 core ignores JSX, so 218 of the 253 "unused" warnings were components used only as `<Foo />`, and an undefined `<Bar />` was never reported. `eslint-plugin-react` now supplies `jsx-uses-vars` and `jsx-no-undef` (it found no undefined component).
    - The 35 real unused bindings are gone, including dead code: the Wire RSS fetcher in `server/homeApi.mjs`, `sampleRows` in `server/deskBrief.mjs`, and `QuestionRecord` and `RegulatoryRecord` (both desks render through `BillRecord`).
    - Of the 13 hook notes: `LiveTvModal` compared a loaded archive against the broadcast selected when the fetch began, so a pick made while it loaded could be overwritten (found by reading, not reproduced; now functional updates). Three desks rebuilt memos every render from a fresh `[]` fallback. `AiPanel` now lists `research.actions`, a stable ref. The other seven are deliberate and carry a reason.
    - `no-unused-vars` is an error and `npm run lint` runs with `--max-warnings 0`. F26 and F27 were found on the way.
  - F21, a lint gate. `npm run lint` (ESLint 9 with `react-hooks`) fails on errors and runs in CI as an advisory step; the warnings are F25. Its first run found two `ReferenceError`s in shipped code, fixed in `03f039c`:
    - the right rail's record detail crashed for rows without an analysis;
    - `/data/news.json` answered 502 when nter.news had no live rows.
  - F17 (part): the `pg_cron` branch verified live. `analytics-events-retention` ran at 03:17 UTC and succeeded; `analytics-rate-windows-purge` 105 of 105 runs; `refresh-model-pricing` 18 of 18. The dev server's 503 without `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` is documented in `README.md`.
  - F20, the desk-row loader writes only new or changed rows and deletes removed keys (`src/lib/deskRowSync.js`, `scripts/load-desk-rows.mjs`). A dry run now reads the stored rows, so it needs the Supabase variables. The first run rewrites most rows once, because the stored `record_text` lines are in jsonb key order. F19 needed no change: the header of `backend/sql/auth_schema.sql` and `Architectures/README.md` already state its fixture-bootstrap role.
  - F13 (part): the generic "Try Reload" error from `reconcileSavedTurn` keeps the real failure as its `cause`, instead of masking read and programming errors (`src/lib/researchChat.js`).
  - F24, the signup plan step runs: a free email signup with a session sees "Choose plan" and can start its trial; a Pro or Enterprise pick enters directly (`src/lib/signupFlow.js`; checked in a browser against a mocked Supabase).
  - F16, the unused `reasoningSegments` modules (browser and Edge copies, and their tests) deleted; `params` and `max_tokens` parked as P15.
  - F14, the model and effort choice survives a reload (per browser, `useResearchThread.js`); F15, the follow-up pills are a labelled list (`SuggestionPills.jsx`).
  - F23, the `--pdf-text` ingest mode in `scripts/ingest-national-desk.mjs` (tests in `src/lib/ingestPdfText.test.js`).
  - F22, a half-precision search index (migrations `20260929120000` and `20260929120100`, live; fixture `halfvec_retrieval.sql`). 204 MB instead of 404 MB; recall@40 0.9875 against 0.990, measured on 20 queries against an exact scan.
  - F10, one account per normalised email (migration `20260929110000_email_unique`, live; fixture `email_unique.sql`); signup explains the refusal (`src/lib/signupErrors.js`). F11, the review of `my_entitlement` and `start_trial` (`Architectures/06` §9.2).
  - F8, preview origins in CORS; F9, no legacy keys in Edge Functions; F12, the chunker's table rule (version 2) (`d1567d1`). All six functions were redeployed from that commit: `health` v8, `admin-models` v8, `refresh-model-pricing` v9, `ingest-documents` v12, `desk-brief` v3, `research-chat` v33. The four that are reachable without a JWT answered their own 401 with the production CORS header.
  - F2 phase 1, server-owned plans (`f74c8c1`; `specs/2026-09-29-f2-entitlements.md`); this file (`docs:` commit of 2026-09-29).
- **2026-09-28/29:**
  - F3, one secret-key name (`3572e53`);
  - F4, Live TV quota (`47fa681`);
  - D4, legacy AI path retired (`14b2344`), and `aiChatStore` removed (`f05a5b6`);
  - D5, rollback runbook;
  - C1, invoices (`19d25e6`);
  - C2, nter.news (`7160391`);
  - C4, admin persona probe (`8a21133`);
  - C5, persona prompt (`c24d379`);
  - C6, testing flag retired (`9e7a125`);
  - C7, UI decisions (`96594d3`, `aee1e8a`);
  - B1 and B2, security reviews (`docs/specs/2026-09-28-authorization-review.md`);
  - B3–B6, tests stop rewriting `public/`, STAT-1 cache, `loadEnv`, CI;
  - A3, operations record.
- **2026-09-28**, the serverless move:
  - T0 (`d55da42`);
  - wave 1: T1 preferences, T2 analytics, T4 flags and media;
  - wave 2: T3, local users retired (`5a2ded0`);
  - T5 and T6 as C1 and C2;
  - the analytics rate limit (`483b3b2`).

  Only T7 (C3) remains.
- **2026-09-22 and earlier:** the first corpus pass, 2,338 documents all
  indexed (`plans/2026-09-21-corpus-ingest-first-pass.md`); scoped
  retrieval; the streaming research agent; citations; desk-row grounding.

## 2. Awaiting the owner's decision

Each needs one answer, then an agent can finish it.

- [ ] **P12. Advisor findings and the dependency audit** (checked 2026-09-29):
  - **`xlsx` 0.18.5: high severity, and no npm fix** (prototype pollution
    and ReDoS). `server/sourceExtract.mjs` parses fetched source documents
    and chat uploads with it, so the input is untrusted. The fix is SheetJS's
    own distribution (`https://cdn.sheetjs.com/xlsx-0.20.3/xlsx-0.20.3.tgz`),
    which is not on npm. Decide whether to allow that source.
  - `vite` 5.4 (the esbuild dev-server advisory) and `vitest` 3.2
    (`@vitest/mocker`): moderate and development-only. The fixes are major
    upgrades (Vite 7+, Vitest 4.1.11+). Decide whether to take them now.
  - Twelve RLS policies call `auth.uid()` per row (`auth_rls_initplan`), and
    six foreign keys have no index. The fix is one migration of
    `(select auth.uid())` rewrites and indexes, which needs approval.
  - By design, recorded under accepted risks:
    - RLS with no policy on six server-only tables;
    - eight `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs callable by signed-in users (they are
      the API);
    - 23 unused indexes (low traffic);
    - three sets of multiple permissive policies.
  - Leaked-password protection and the Auth connection strategy are
    dashboard settings (D1).
- [ ] **F30. The other hand-written marketing figures** (found while doing
  P16). They weren't part of P16's approval:
  - `src/marketing/HomePage.jsx` shows "9,819" bills in four places (lines
    36, 290, 584 and 736); the carousel now says 9,817 unique bills;
  - "211+" live API endpoints (`HomePage.jsx:286` and `:727`, and
    `PricingPage.jsx:135`);
  - "UPTIME 99.9%" (`HomePage.jsx:294`, `PricingPage.jsx:143`), which nothing
    measures.

  Decide per figure: compute it (the bills count can reuse P16's), keep it
  as a constant, or drop it.

## 3. RAG v2: retrieval and page-aware ingestion (in progress)

Designed on 2026-09-30. The map and every decision are in
`specs/2026-09-30-rag-v2-capability-map.md`, and the evidence in
`research/2026-09-30-rag-v2-investigation.md`. The old runbook
`plans/2026-09-29-corpus-ingestion.md` is superseded: its measurements stand,
but its commands aren't to be run.

Part 1 is planned in `plans/2026-09-30-rag-v2-retrieval-and-contract.md`
(tasks T1–T17):

- [x] **R1. `eval`** (spec `specs/2026-09-30-rag-v2-eval.md`). Done on
  2026-10-01 (`952d4e8`):
  - the frozen set of 195 questions and its vectors;
  - the harness;
  - the live baseline in `research/2026-09-30-retrieval-baseline.md`
    (broad doc@10 85.3%, focused chunk@10 97.8%).

  The 20-question owner review was done by the supervisor on the owner's
  behalf.
- [x] **R2. `retrieval-scope`**. Done on 2026-10-01:
  - migration `20261001100000`, and `research-chat` deployed from `2d4f9bd`;
  - frontend `6f1b94b`;
  - live eval "no worse", with the desk filter at doc@10 171/184 against 157;
  - F32 fixed by `document_modules()`.

  Remaining: the owner's signed-in check of the button.
- [x] **R3. `chunk-contract`**. Done on 2026-10-01 (`b9bcb6c`):
  - migration `20261001120000` live;
  - `research-chat` and `ingest-documents` redeployed;
  - page text rules, the page chunker (version 3), citation fields, and the refusal of
    page-aware documents by the old path;
  - the ADR 0002 and 0004 amendments.

  Live eval "no worse".

Part 2 needs its specs first, in this order:

- [ ] **R4. `ingestion-v2`** (spec `specs/2026-10-01-rag-v2-ingestion-v2.md`,
  approved; plan `plans/2026-10-01-rag-v2-ingestion-v2.md`):
  - a private `corpus` bucket, content-addressed by file hash;
  - a job-table queue (skip-locked claims, lease, fencing), with a pg_cron
    timer switched on by the owner;
  - the `ingest-worker` Edge Function running Mistral OCR in page ranges and
    indexing slice by slice;
  - first extractions only.

  The owner sets `MISTRAL_API_KEY` and runs the secret steps.

  Built on `task/rag-v2-ingestion-v2` (I0–I5, checkpoint D, 2026-10-01). The
  local end-to-end run (I7) passed:
  `research/2026-10-01-ingestion-v2-local-run.md`, $0.197. Next: checkpoint
  E (the owner reads that report), then I8 on NTER, with a go-ahead per step.
  `MISTRAL_API_KEY` is already set on NTER (the owner, 2026-10-01).
  **Live on NTER, 2026-10-01** (`agents/coordination.md`): migration 39, the worker
  secret, both functions deployed, and the first document (the 12-page bill) ingested
  for $0.048. The schedule is off. Remaining: the owner's signed-in citation check, then
  mark R4 done.
- [ ] **R5.** A pilot of about 10 PDFs from the candidates in the research
  doc §6, which proves pages, boxes, images, cost and re-run cost.
- [ ] **R6. `citations-pdf`.** The PDF.js viewer with box highlights; a
  page label and image strip in the reader; signed URLs.
  Requirement from R3: `WorkSurface`, `SourceList` (`AiPanel.jsx`) and
  `AiMarkdown` must pass citations through `sanitizeCitation`
  (`src/ai/CitationBubble.jsx`) before drawing boxes or images.
  **Owner direction, 2026-10-01:**
  - a page-wise viewer that shows a citation both on the original PDF and on the OCR text,
    as today;
  - the OCR text view gains a page switcher;
  - legacy documents keep their current text view unchanged;
  - the DDL Labs project has the same implementation, to be used as a reference.

  The data is ready. Verified on NTER (the Anti-Doping bill, `bill:2025:77`): every stored
  citation carries `page_number`, page-normalised `boxes`, the character span, `chunk_id`,
  `section`, `extract_hash` and `file_url`.
- [ ] **R7. `acquisition`.** Download the 5,327 linked `pdf_text`
  records (5,218 sansad.in bills), then backfill on a separate owner
  go-ahead. This replaces L1 for the linked records; the unlinked ones wait
  for R8.
  Finding (I7, 2026-10-01): rbidocs.rbi.org.in answers a scripted download
  with "Request Rejected", and may refuse Mistral's fetch as well. Its 76
  links need another route, such as an admin upload.
- [ ] **R8. `admin-upload`.** A platform-admin upload tab, with splitting
  in the browser. Spec `specs/2026-10-01-rag-v2-admin-upload.md` (draft,
  approved 2026-10-01). Moved ahead of R5–R7 by the owner
  (2026-10-01): it is the milestone.
  Built on `task/rag-v2-admin-upload` (B0–B4, checkpoint F). The local end
  to end (B5) passed: `research/2026-10-01-admin-upload-local-run.md`.
  **Live on NTER, 2026-10-01** (`agents/coordination.md`): migration 40,
  `admin-ingest`, the Documents tab, and the schedule ON. Remaining: the owner's
  upload of *Budget at a Glance* with "split every 10 pages" and the citation
  check on pages 10/11. Then mark R8 done and make the plan Historical.
  **Amendment A** (records-first document management, approved 2026-10-01; plan
  `plans/2026-10-01-rag-v2-admin-records.md`): built on `task/admin-records`
  (C0–C4, migration `20261001180000_corpus_records`), checkpoint H passed, and the
  local end to end (C5) passed: `research/2026-10-01-admin-records-local-run.md`.
  Next: checkpoint I (the owner reads it), then C6 on NTER with a go-ahead per step
  (migration, then `admin-ingest`, then the frontend; then the owner's three checks).

Follow-ups and findings:

- [ ] **F31.** `deno.lock` is stale: it still lists `sql.js` (removed in C3)
  and lacks the ESLint packages. Regenerate it in its own commit.
- [x] **F32.** (fixed by R2, 2026-10-01) `research-chat` `documentModules` (`index.ts:265-281`)
  reads one row per document with no range. PostgREST caps a read at
  `max_rows` 1000, so modules can be missing from the list. Fixed by R2
  (`document_modules()`).
- [ ] **F33.** A document picker (title search), to focus on a document no
  answer has cited yet.
- [ ] **F34.** Let the model choose a desk filter itself. It needs an
  answer-level evaluation first.
- [ ] **F35.** NTER's unscoped search loses results to its HNSW index.
  Measured 2026-10-01 in `research/2026-10-01-feature-filter-measurements.md`:
  - against an exact search, NTER's top 40 has a recall of 0.913;
  - exact search finds the right document in the top 10 for 170 of 184
    questions, NTER's index for 157;
  - Budget and Industry are lost on NTER's index build.

  Next: measure raising `hnsw.ef_search` for the unscoped branch (100–200)
  with the `eval` harness, on the replica and then live.
  Also measure lowering the feature filter's exact threshold T (15,000)
  so that Regulatory takes the index path. Its exact scan takes 733 ms on
  NTER.
- [ ] **F36.** `_shared/logging.ts` redacts by field name, and any name
  containing "token" is hidden. So `embed_tokens` and other counts appear as
  `[redacted]` in Edge logs (seen in the I7 run). Names containing "key" are
  hidden too: `document_key`, `expected_key` and `key_holder` in `admin-ingest`'s
  logs (C5). Redact known secret names and secret-shaped values instead.
- [ ] **F38.** A sweeper for `corpus/staging/` objects older than 24 h, and
  for content-addressed objects no document references after a discard
  (admin-upload spec, "Follow-ups").
- [ ] **F39.** `research-chat`'s `featureScopeOf` keeps only the first
  spelling of a desk feature (`handler.ts:515-536`). It should collect every
  spelling, e.g. "(RBI / SEBI / TRAI / CCI)" and "(RBI/SEBI/TRAI/CCI)".
- [ ] **F40.** Rows in 73 of 75 desk features carry no `document_key`, so a dropped row
  from those desks can never attach its document. Only the two bill features have keys. This
  needs stable keys from the loader for every row, and a generalised client key in place of
  `billDocumentKey`. It is admin-upload Amendment A, part A4, and needs its own spec.
- [ ] **F41.** A widened chat turn is slow: on 2026-10-01 a bill question waited 65 s, of which
  Gemini Flash took 46 s on a 25,850-token prompt. Search took 0.6 s. Measure the prompt size
  of widened turns and cap it.
- [ ] **F42.** Show page numbers in the current text citation reader before the PDF viewer
  (R6) lands. Page-aware chunks already return `page_number`, blocks and the section.
- [ ] **F37.** The `index` step recomposes the whole document on every
  claim. It took 547 ms of laptop CPU for 1,000 pages (I7), so a split
  document of 3,000 or more pages would pass the spec's 1.5 s threshold.
  Persist the composed pages after the first run (the spec's own fallback)
  before ingesting documents that large.

Earlier items, updated:

- [ ] **L1.** The 18,071 never-ingested `pdf_text` documents: 7,966 bills,
  6,758 parliamentary questions, 2,813 regulatory documents and others.
  The 5,327 with direct links are R7. The rest have no link and wait for
  admin upload (R8) or an API source.
- [ ] **L2.** Law tier: 874 Supreme Court and NCLT PDFs. First confirm they
  have a text layer.
- [ ] **P5.** Page-level citations. Now R3 and R6, for new documents. The
  2,338 existing documents keep unpaged citations (owner decision,
  2026-09-30).
- [ ] **P6.** Reranking and hybrid keyword search, after the corpus grows.
- [ ] **P7.** Affidavits (10,492 documents, 809 M characters; 5,093 current,
  100,151 pages). **Out of scope by owner decision (2026-09-30):** no links,
  personal data.
- [ ] **P8.** Re-crawl the 716 documents that have no `file_url`.
- [ ] **P9.** Document keys for parliamentary questions and regulators;
  desk-row "cut two" (curated views, the 41 modules with no rows) and a
  refresh pipeline.
- [ ] **P14.** Bill-key collisions (two documents on one `bill:<year>:<number>`
  key). Accept, or keep one document per key.

## 4. Payments

- [ ] **F6.** Plan gating on the server, before real payments. Desk data is
  public (static files, and `desk_rows` is readable by any signed-in user).
  Locks, row caps and export limits run only in the browser. The spec must
  settle which data is premium, how premium desks are served (an API behind
  `my_entitlement`, or RLS), server-side exports and API row caps.
- [ ] **O6.** After F6: the Razorpay keys on Vercel, then one real payment
  end to end.
- [ ] **P2.** Organisation seats, organisation billing, Razorpay
  subscriptions.
- [ ] **P3.** Metering and credits (ADR 0002); an effort column in
  `model_call_logs`.

## 5. Launch

- [ ] **D1. Supabase dashboard: what remains.** The Auth redirect URLs are
  done (see Done), and leaked-password protection was dropped by the owner
  (see accepted risks). Left:
  - confirm the Storage global upload limit is at least 50 MB. The
    `marketing` bucket allows 50 MB and Supabase's default global limit is
    50 MB, but no tool here can read the global setting. The O8 intro-video
    upload proves it either way;
  - optionally, Auth connections as a percentage.

  The tools can't change Auth or Storage settings safely: the CLI's
  `config push` would overwrite the whole remote config.
- [ ] **O8 and A2. Signed-in smoke test on production** with a test
  account:
  - save preferences;
  - upload the intro video;
  - switch to Academic and ask one question (the answer opens with
    RESEARCH QUESTION / EVIDENCE / CHRONOLOGY).

  Agents may not create accounts or sign in on production, so this is the
  owner's. Afterwards an agent can check the rows with read-only SQL.
- [ ] **D2. nter.pro cutover:**
  - DNS to this Vercel project;
  - the Google OAuth client for the domain;
  - Resend email delivery, with `mailer_autoconfirm` back off;
  - nter.pro in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and the Auth URLs;
  - clean up the old upstream setup.

  The owner doesn't have the domain settings yet.
- [ ] **D3. Paid live round.** Five paid-model scenarios plus a
  cross-account denial check, including:
  - the first live `search_documents` turn with a highlighted span;
  - the admin persona chat on Gemini Lite, Gemini Flash and GPT Astra;
  - medium and high reasoning in production.
- [ ] **P11.** Whether `require_parameters` makes reasoning a hard routing
  constraint, and whether a single attachment should be capped at its
  per-document quota. Decided on D3's evidence.

## 6. Waiting on owner assets

- [ ] **F7 / O7.** Live TV content is partly invented. `server/liveTvApi.mjs:664`
  serves a hand-written transcript labelled "ASR Verified Record"; `:609` is
  an invented archive entry; channels without a schedule get placeholder
  programmes. It needs the new Live TV sources, UI and sample codebase.
- [ ] **O9.** The desk-landing visual mockup that
  `specs/2026-09-27-cr12-cr13-desk-landing.md` is waiting for.
- [ ] **O1.** `NTER_TERMINAL_API_KEY` on Vercel, and nter.news pointed at
  production. Until then every nter.news push is refused.
- [ ] **P1.** Database-backed home feeds (`plans/2026-09-23-home-feeds-plan.md`).
  It needs the schema agreed and a market-data vendor. The conflict pulse
  still shows the static war list.

## 7. Accepted risks and won't-fix

Each can be reopened by the condition named.

- **DNS rebinding in source fetching** (`specs/2026-09-28-authorization-review.md`).
  It needs a signed-in account. Closing it would mean pinning the resolved
  address in the HTTP client.
- **A disabled service-role JWT in public git history** (`25723f7`). The key
  is disabled, and removing it would mean rewriting `main`.
- **1,288 documents with unknown `integrity`.** It can't be recovered from
  the inputs.
- **No leaked-password protection** (Supabase's HaveIBeenPwned check).
  Dropped by the owner on 2026-09-29. Most accounts sign in with Google;
  email accounts keep Supabase's password rules. Reopen before a public
  launch if email sign-ups grow.
- **Previews share the live Supabase project.** There is no Supabase
  branching. Test writes use test accounts only, and migrations stay
  additive and fixture-tested.
- **The preview wildcard in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.** Anyone can name a Vercel
  project so that its `*.vercel.app` host matches
  `niyantran-*-ddl-labs.vercel.app`. The functions authenticate with a
  bearer token that a foreign page can't read, so an allowed origin gains
  nothing. Reopen if any function starts accepting cookies.
- **Advisor findings that are by design** (see P12): RLS with no policy on
  server-only tables, the `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs that are the API, unused
  indexes at today's traffic, and multiple permissive policies.
- **P4. Deferred agent features:** web search, compaction, memories, user
  uploads and binary attachments, a durable queue for long turns. Not
  planned until the owner schedules them.
- **P10.** Google sign-ups, and email sign-ups that wait for verification,
  skip the plan step and get no signup trial. They can start one from the
  upgrade dialog. Reopen if it matters commercially.
- **P13.** Two ADRs are numbered 0005. Left unless the ADRs are renumbered.
- **P15.** Two unused extension points, kept on purpose: `ai_models.params`
  and `StreamRequest.max_tokens`. Wire them up when a model needs either.
- **P17.** `reconcileSavedTurn` answers `false` both for "still locked" and
  for a repeat call; a test pins it and the only caller handles it. Reopen
  if a caller needs to tell them apart.
